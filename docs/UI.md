# Sidebar UI Specification

This document defines the Sidebar UI for AC Companion Python, covering layout, states, and behaviors. No implementation is included.

## Layout

Header
- Title: Problem name (primary) and group (secondary)
- Controls: Interpreter toggle [CPython | PyPy], Run All button

Body
- Test List (collapsible by default if > 10 tests)
  - Row per test: `#<index>` + status badge + per-test Run button
  - Sections inside each row (expandable):
    - Expected (read-only, monospace)
    - Actual (after run, monospace)
    - Console (stderr on failure only, monospace)

Footer
- Runtime info: interpreter, timeout ms, cwd mode

## States

1) Idle (no problem loaded)
- Empty state message: "No tests yet. Send from Competitive Companion."
- Disabled controls except interpreter toggle

2) Problem loaded (not run)
- Render header with name/group
- Show test list with Expected sections collapsed
- Enable Run All and per-test Run

3) Running
- Global spinner near Run All when running all
- Per-test spinner on running row when running one
- Disable conflicting actions (prevent duplicate runs)

4) Results (post-run)
- Status badge values: Pass (green), Fail (red), Timeout (orange), RE (purple)
- Actual visible by default for failed tests; collapsed for passed tests
- Console visible only for failed tests; suppress known PyPy warning lines

## Behavior

- Interpreter toggle updates setting and optionally offers to re-run last scope
- Run All executes tests serially (v1)
- Run One executes only selected index
- Keyboard focus order respects accessibility; buttons are reachable by tab
- Monospace sections support copy; limit very long content with collapsible containers

## Status Badge Tokens

- pass: background `#2EA043`, fg `#FFFFFF`
- fail: background `#D1242F`, fg `#FFFFFF`
- timeout: background `#DAAA3F`, fg `#000000`
- re: background `#8957E5`, fg `#FFFFFF`

## Empty & Unsupported Cases

- Interactive problems: show inline banner "Interactive problems are not supported" and disable run controls
- Missing interpreters: show warning notice with remediation steps

## Wireframe (Text)
